                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in San Diego. When I was very young, my family moved to the Bay Area. We bounced around for a little bit near
                    Berkeley before settling in the small town of Martinez.

                        Martinez is actually the hometown of naturalist John Muir!

                    Sometime in high school, I became interested in computer science, and in college, I was enamored with web development. 
                    I decided to pursue this as my career path!

                <h2>Skills and Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently a third-year Math-Computer Science major at UCSD. My skills currently encompass 
                    <em>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</em>, and also <em>React, Tailwind, and Next.js</em> (sorry <abbr>Prof.</abbr> Powell). Also, if you
                    ever need a qualified ice cream/dessert expert, I've worked at both Baskin-Robbins and Matcha Cafe Maiko.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I grew up playing the piano. I took lessons for a while but now I play every once in a while. Recently, I've been more 
                    interested in the acoustic guitar. I'm still an amateur, but I'm learning!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite artists according to my Spotify wrapped for 2024 are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
                    <li>Olivia Rodrigo</li>
                    <li>Kanye West</li>
                    <li>Laufey</li>
                    <li>Tyler, The Creator</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I love going to concerts and live events; in fact, I've already gone to see Laufey and I'm seeing Kendrick and Tyler
                    this year!
